# Mathematical_Optimization
Project work from the course in mathematical optimization at LTH.

The task was to compare two slightly different quasi-newton methods: the DFP-method and the BFGS-method. Furthermore test cases were done on constrained optimization using both penalty and barrier methods.

The code in grad.m, rosenbrock.m and test_func.m was given.

Challenges was mainly dealing with implementation errors which put heavy emphasis on our test-script being diverse enough to capture enough different function behaviours so that the errors was made visible.
